# <u>Flask intro</u>

Notably Flask handles all the URL requests from the browser and activates the necessary functions. 
Secondly it does data handling using GET and POST. It acts as the middle man between user and the database.
Flask is used for :
1) User authentication
2) API handling
3) Password hashing : salting + hashing
4) HTML integration
