# <u>Virtual Environment</u>

A space separate from the global folder which runs its own modules and library of the required version.
You set up a virtual env by typing : (this code is for windows)
```python
>>>pip install virtualenv
>>>virtualenv env
>>>.\env\Scripts\Activate.ps1 
```
The first line of code installs the module
The second line of code installs a virtual environment. 
The third activates it.
Now a env file would be created in your folder.
