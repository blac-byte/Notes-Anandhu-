# Password hashing
---

A security measure that not only secures your application but also of other's since people tend to reuse the same password.
Password hashing means one way encrypting the password to secure it. A unique password always produces a unique hash.

But using only hashing has its own flaws since the attacker could brute force with a rainbow table.
