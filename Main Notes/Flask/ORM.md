# <u>ORM</u>

Object Relational Mapping (ORM) lets you define your database structure as **Python classes**, and SQLAlchemy automatically maps them to **SQL tables** behind the scenes, making the process clean and readable. 
In the same line AWS uses another DB to store the data sent by the flask application.

# <u>Connecting Flask to a DB</u>

 ==db=SQLAlchemy(app)== this connects your app with a DB. Hence ORM becomes that pathway for your application to interact with the DB
