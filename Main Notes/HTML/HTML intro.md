# <u>HTML</u>

There exists HTML and then CSS. 
If HTML is the bones, then CSS is the muscles that give the definition to the frame. So write in HTML, stylize in CSS.

Save the file as 'index.html' since that is the default file browsers search to load.


# Body of HTML

# Different tags

Heading - ```<h1> <h2> <h3> <h4> <h5> <h6>```
Paragraph - ```<p>```
Span - ```<span>```
Lists - ```<UL> <OL> <LI>```

Format - ```<form> </form>```
Division - ```<div> </div>```
Break - ```<br>```
Entry - ```<input>```
Link - ```<a href='some form of link'> </a>```

# Boiler plate HTML
This is the repeating code which basically goes over every specification that is needed for a browser to load the HTML. So it would be always repeated in every program

# Template inheritance
The aim is to avoid boiler plate codes. Who wants to keep rewriting the same old code. To avoid that you assign a master, i.e. a format that will be same for all the other html files.

Find the syntax yourself for flask, ya fauk !
